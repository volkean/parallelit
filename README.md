# parallel-it

Sample project for parallel integration tests using testcontainers.

There is also jacoco minimum coverage limit configuration in maven project file for demonstration. It forces you to
cover at least %90 service classes.

I will add some persistence abilities to play more with challenges related to concurrent execution of tests. Main
goal is to explore how to speed it up.

This project uses https://ipstack.com/documentation api for educational purposes. You can create your own ipstack api
key to try it out.
